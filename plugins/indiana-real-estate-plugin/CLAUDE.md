# Central Indiana Real Estate Agent Plugin

## What This Plugin Does

This plugin provides a comprehensive AI skill suite for residential real estate agents operating in Central Indiana within the MIBOR/BLC territory. It covers the full buying and selling lifecycle — from initial client consultations through closing — and is designed to serve multiple agents via personalized config files.

**18 skills + orchestrator — all phases complete (Phase 0–5).** Plugin follows standard Claude Code plugin conventions:
- **Skills** live in `skills/` (e.g., `skills/re-cma/SKILL.md`)
- **Commands** (slash commands) live in `commands/` (e.g., `commands/re-cma.md`)
- **Agents** live in `agents/` (e.g., `agents/orchestrator.md`)
- A SKILL.md stub for the orchestrator lives at `orchestrator/SKILL.md`.

## Config System

Every agent-specific detail lives in YAML config files — never hardcoded. The same skills serve any agent.

### Config Location
```
config/[agent-slug]/
```

Each agent has up to 7 config files:
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agent-profile.yaml` | Identity, license, brokerage, voice/tone, methodology |
| `brand-kit.yaml` | Colors, fonts, logos, tagline, hashtags, compliance disclaimers |
| `vendor-network.yaml` | Preferred lenders, inspectors, title companies, contractors, etc. |
| `fee-structure.yaml` | Commission rates, fees, buyer agreement terms — SENSITIVE |
| `market-areas.yaml` | Counties, cities, neighborhoods, zip codes, farm areas |
| `email-templates.yaml` | Signature block, per-milestone email templates |
| `team-structure.yaml` | Team members, roles, TC contact, showing assistant |

Templates for all 7 files are in `config/_template/`.

### Agent Identification Pattern

**Step 1: Look up the Monday.com "Real Estate Agent Registry" board.**

The board is the authoritative index. Look up agents by:
- Full name (`Name` column)
- Email (`Email` column)
- Slug (`Slug` column — kebab-case folder name)

This returns the `Slug` (e.g., `jane-smith-fc-tucker`).

**Step 2: Load config files from `config/[slug]/`.**

```
config/jane-smith-fc-tucker/
├── agent-profile.yaml    # Always load first — establishes identity and voice
├── brand-kit.yaml        # Load for any output with branding
├── vendor-network.yaml   # Load when recommending vendors
├── fee-structure.yaml    # Load for net sheets, agreement discussions
├── market-areas.yaml     # Load for geographic context
├── email-templates.yaml  # Load for any client communication
└── team-structure.yaml   # Load when routing to team members
```

**If agent not found:** Ask the user to run `/re-agent-setup` to create the agent config.

**If slug provided directly:** Skip the Monday.com lookup and load config files directly.

### Monday.com Agent Registry Board Schema

**Board name:** "Real Estate Agent Registry"

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Name | text | Agent full name |
| Slug | text | kebab-case config folder name (e.g., `jane-smith-fc-tucker`) |
| Brokerage | text | Brokerage name |
| Phone | phone | Agent phone number |
| Email | email | Agent email address |
| License # | text | Indiana real estate license number |
| MLS ID | text | MIBOR BLC member ID |
| Config Status | status | "Setup Complete" / "Partial" / "Not Started" |
| Google Drive | link | Agent's Google Drive folder for transaction docs |
| Last Active | date | Last date plugin was used for this agent |

`re-agent-setup` creates the Monday.com row and local config files. All other skills read from this board.

## Reference System

Shared Indiana-specific legal, market, and practice references live in:
```
references/
```

| File | Contains |
|---|---|
| `indiana-agency-law.md` | IC 25-34.1-9-11, agency types, duties, limited agency rules |
| `indiana-disclosure-requirements.md` | IC 32-21-5-10, disclosure form requirements, what to disclose |
| `mibor-forms-checklist.md` | Complete MIBOR/IAR forms list with when each is used |

| `real-estate-vocabulary.md` | Approved terminology, fair housing language, Indiana terms |

All skills should reference these files for Indiana-specific content rather than inventing general guidance.

## Orchestrator

The orchestrator lives at `agents/orchestrator.md` and is the default entry point when working in this plugin directory (see `settings.json`). It coordinates multi-skill workflows, identifies agents, assesses transaction state, and routes to the right skill. Use it when starting a new client engagement or when the user doesn't know which skill to invoke.

A SKILL.md stub at `orchestrator/SKILL.md` provides a reference index of all workflows and skills for discovery purposes. Full orchestrator logic is in `agents/orchestrator.md` only.

The orchestrator uses the `real-estate-plugin:skill-name` prefix format in its frontmatter `skills:` list (e.g., `real-estate-plugin:re-cma`). All 18 skills are listed. `re-agent-setup` is included for new agent onboarding.

## Skill Development Conventions

- **Step 1 of every skill:** "Load Agent Config" — read `agent-profile.yaml` + any other needed configs. If not found, direct to `re-agent-setup`.
- **SKILL.md line limit:** 500 lines maximum. Extract heavy content to each skill's own `references/` subdirectory and link.
- **Skill location:** All skills live in `skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`
- **Command location:** All slash commands live in `commands/[skill-name].md`
- **Config paths:** Always use `config/[slug]/[file].yaml`
- **Reference paths:** Always use `references/[file].md`
- **Template paths:** Always use `templates/[file].md`
- **Branding:** All output must use the agent's name, tagline, colors, and signature from config — never generic placeholders.
- **Fair housing:** All content must comply with federal Fair Housing Act and HUD language guidelines. See `references/real-estate-vocabulary.md`.

## Beta Telemetry (Temporary)

The plugin includes opt-in telemetry for beta testing. When `beta.telemetry` is set to `true` in an agent's `agent-profile.yaml`, the orchestrator silently logs skill invocations, completions, and errors to `logs/beta-telemetry.jsonl` (local file, never committed to git). Logs capture: timestamps, agent slug, skill names, event types, and error categories. No client names, fees, or financial data are logged.

Beta testers can run `/re-report-issue` to send feedback to the development team via a Zapier webhook. This works in both CLI and Cowork — no accounts or installs required. The agent reviews and approves every report before it's sent.

To disable telemetry for an agent, set `beta.telemetry: false` in their `agent-profile.yaml`. This system will be removed after the beta period.

## Scheduled Tasks (v2 Roadmap)

Scheduled tasks (weekly market pulls, daily deadline reminders, monthly anniversary alerts) are planned for v2. See `scheduled/README.md`.
